# UGV-Manual-Control-and-Autonomous-Mapping

Using LabVIEW, a ground vehicle was keyboard controlled to scan a field of metals (over-ground and under-ground) simulating mines. The ground vehicle was programmed to be able to differentiate the over-ground mines from the under-ground ones and build a map of their exact locations in the field.

This was part of the tasks required for the Minesweepers Competition.
